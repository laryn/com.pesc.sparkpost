# SparkPost / CiviCRM Integration
Integrates SparkPost to CiviCRM, so email can be sent out over the SparkPost service and bounces can be processed in CiviCRM

## What This Extension Does
* Adds a tag to all outgoing CiviMail messages. The civi-generated return-path is added as a SparkPost tag, because like most SMTP services, SparkPost strips out the return-path header for its own.
* Adds a scheduled job that uses SparkPost API to fetch bounce events and processes their bounces in CiviCRM. I use the hash included in the SparkPost tag
* Adds Bounce type and Pattern that helps with marking emails on hold in CiviCRM that SparkPost has added to it's suppression list

##Setup Steps
1. Create SparkPost Account
2.	Add Sending Domain and verify domain
3.	Create API key with appropriate permissions, save this API key
  * “Select All” is easiest way, but you may want to change this for your needs
